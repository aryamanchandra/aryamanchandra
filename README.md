## 👋🏻 Hi! I am Aryaman.

Hey there! I’m Aryaman Chandra from New Delhi, a high school student of Delhi Public School, R.K. Puram. I am a designer by heart and developer by mind. I want to try new stuff all the time. In my free time, I usually sleep and overthink. I am an ambivert who likes to spend time learning new stuff. I sometimes read a random book or an article or just find some youtube video (unless I wander off to social media :D).
